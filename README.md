Hello World!


This is my first website I made. I started compiling these site from 2 November 2023 as a hobby , from bare minimum site to now something different and unique. Time flies like flash. Its kind of fun compiling these site , but as usual more features = more bugs. I had to gone through fixing a ton lot of stuffs in order to add features and still I am fixing stuffs for these site in order to add new features to the site as I kind of love compiling site. I always believe in " Life without happiness is like useless to live. So, try to enjoy your life. "

Talking about the website , its a site where 17 players info's are available , in this site you can compare against other players available in this site. This site features unique designs which are not so much common in other websites; also it features login and signup through verified email and pass , google by the help of firebase ; for logged in users this site features no ads for them and the ability to vote for the players among the listed 17 players in this site but for non logged in users this site features ads for them. Users can verify the email, delete, create their account, change the password, submit and update vote thanks to firebase. It also features user info for the logged in user and features live chart voting result. This site uses bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome, firebase, google fonts, javascript, css, npm, wikipedia api, node js, recaptcha.

As a newbie in web development, I am still trying my level best in order to add new features to the site. I hope you guys are enjoying it.
